# Pneumonia_healthcare
In this Project, I have preprocessesed the images as to avoid differ resolution, contrast, size,to have a final (1024, 1024) size, I am using here tenserflow, numpy, openCV, sklearn module and by using deep leaning sequential model from keras.model under the tensorflow, after trainig for 50 eopch with batch size 74. I am able to train the model on 1127 CXR normal, and 995 CXR Pneumonia images, i am getting the accuracy as 64.56 testing accuracy.
